👋 Hi, I’m @pawan856
👀 I’m interested in web development, especially using .NET, ASP.NET, Angular, and Oracle databases.
🌱 I’m currently learning Angular 18 and exploring advanced features of ASP.NET and MVC architecture with .NET 8.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving full-stack development, CRUD operations, and data integration.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via GitHub for collaboration or any queries.
